The game that I have make is mainly inspired by the classic 2D Snake Game. 
The gameplay is mostly the same except I have added a new mechanic in the form of 
blue food as well as the classic red food. While the red food works the same as it 
normally does by adding a point to the total score, and making the snake longer, 
the blue food works in the opposing way. The game ends when either the snake dies 
by hitting a wall, itself, or somehow reaching 0 points by eating blue food, which 
results in a loss. The game is won once the player reaches 50 points.

When planning this project I originally wanted to have a 2 player version of the 
game where there was 2 snakes with a different set of controls competing to get the 
higher score, however I underestimated how long it would take me to get the single 
player version up and running itself so I ended up abandoning the idea.

My starting idea for this project was to have it themed around dragons instead of 
snakes, however I struggled to find meaning behind a reason that I wanted the game 
to have this style. The reason that this game inspired me was because it's a very 
old and popular game that has been redesigned in several ways. It's a game that 
everyone knows and it is still able to enjoy it at any age, however I still find 
it to be a very nostalgic experience. I wanted to take this game and put a bit of 
a more thoughtful meaning behind it, so I made it about endangered animals, and 
the aim of the game is to help the snake avoid becoming extinct. 

I drew my own assets for the game to give it my own style, however I wanted to keep 
it very simple to match how simple the concept of the game is.
